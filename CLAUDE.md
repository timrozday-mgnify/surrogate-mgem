# CLAUDE.md — surrogate-mgem

> ## Design north star — read this first

> The project is **pivoting** to the v2 design spec:
> [`docs/design/community-fba-surrogates-plan-v2.md`](docs/design/community-fba-surrogates-plan-v2.md).
> That document is the authoritative map — milestones **M0…M8**, locked
> decisions **D1…D10**, validation gates **V0…V8**, pitfalls **P0…P15**. Orient
> to it before starting work.
>
> The target architecture is **JAX/Equinox** with **per-organism CarveMe FBA**
> ground truth (not MICOM community solves): a concave value head (`mu_max`), a
> behaviour head (exchange fluxes), shadow-price Sobolev training, elastic-net
> label uniqueness, and Newton composition. New work lands under **`src/cfs/`**.
>
> The existing **`src/surrogate_mgem/`** package (PyTorch + MICOM growth

> **Progress:** M0 + M1 done (`src/cfs/groundtruth/qc.py`, `index.py`,
> `src/cfs/validate/degeneracy.py`) — QC, frozen/hashed metabolite index, and the
> degeneracy survey that settled **D4 = elastic net** (§5.4). M2 solve interface
> done (`src/cfs/groundtruth/solve.py`) — MM uptake bounds (§3.3), two-stage
> FBA + **HiGHS elastic-net QP** for `mu_max`, exchange fluxes `z`, and metabolite
> shadow prices. **Next: the sampling design (§4)** — active-subspace reduction +
> stratified low-concentration media — then bulk parquet label generation.

## Legacy package (surrogate_mgem)

Two layers: a Python package (`src/surrogate_mgem/`, the surrogate model + CLI)
and a Nextflow pipeline (`main.nf` + `workflows/` + `modules/`) that scales
training across an HPC cluster. This page is the map; read the linked code for
detail.

## Python package

`surrogate-mgem <subcommand>` (`cli.py`), consumed by the pipeline:

| Subcommand | Does | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generate` | Sample communities + media, solve MICOM, write tidy CSVs. Shardable via `--num-shards/--shard-index` (shard 0 writes `exchange_universe.json`). | `data` extra (micom/cobra) |
| `train` | Fit a fixed-community ensemble. Sweep knobs: `--hidden` (layers×width), `--n-models` (ensemble size), `--n-train` (training-row cap), `--n-features` (input width). Writes `train_metrics.json`. | torch only |
| `active-round` | One active-learning round for one community: train acquisition ensemble → solve a diverse high-uncertainty batch → append to the tidy tables (single-community output dir). | `data` extra |
| `report` | Quarto performance report (local, not in the HPC path). | `report` extra + quarto |

Model: `model.py` `GrowthSurrogate` (standardising ReLU MLP; `hidden` architecture
is **persisted in the checkpoint** so a sweep can vary it). `ensemble.py`
`GrowthEnsemble` (deep ensemble → predictive std = acquisition signal).
`active.py` `active_round` / `active_learning_loop`. `train.py`
`run_active_round` does the tidy-table writeback.

## Nextflow pipeline

House style mirrors `../subspecies-phylogeny`: DSL2, meta maps, `conf/base.config`
labels + retry, `conf/modules.config` for `ext.args`/publishDir, nf-test stub
tests, per-process container ternary.

`main.nf` has two stages via `--stage` (default `train`):

- **`qc`** — M0+M1 ground-truth QC (`workflows/groundtruth_qc.nf`, the v2 pivot).
  `QC_MODELS` (whole roster: EGC gate + MEMOTE, freeze
  `${outdir}/qc/metabolite_index.json`) → `DEGENERACY_SURVEY` (per organism,
  exchange-FVA — the FVA is the cost, hence per-genome fan-out + `process_high`)
  → `COLLECT_D4` (roster-wide `d4_recommendation.json`; advisory — the human
  records D4). CLI: `cfs {qc, freeze-index, degeneracy}` (`src/cfs/cli.py`).
  Run this first, before any `train`. Stub: `tests/qc.nf.test`.
- **`train`** — the legacy sweep below.

DAG (`workflows/surrogate_training.nf`):

```

                                                                 │

### Conventions / things easy to get wrong

- **Iteration lives inside a process, not the DAG.** Nextflow forbids invoking a
  process more than once, so `ACTIVE_LEARN` folds `params.active_rounds` discrete
  `active-round` calls in a bash loop (like the reference's `accumulating_merge`),
  rather than unrolling per-round Nextflow tasks. Each round is still a distinct
  CLI invocation that grows the dataset.
- **Data-size sweep = `--n-train` cap** on a fixed dataset (a learning curve), not
  active-round snapshots.
- **Containers only** (no bioconda package) — the modules are container-only with
  no `environment.yml`; the `conda` profile won't cover them. Two images, built
  out-of-repo via `docker/{train,data}.Dockerfile`, referenced by GHCR convention
  (`ghcr.io/timrozday-mgnify/surrogate-mgem-{train,data}:0.1.2`). Bump the tag in
  all five modules together. No `-sif` ORAS artifacts are published, so the
  modules name the Docker image plainly (no nf-core `oras://` ternary) and
  singularity/apptainer converts on first pull.
- **Media sampling is the whole ballgame — use `titrate`.** A random nutrient
  subset (`sparse`) practically never contains the organism's essential set, so
  growth is 0 for every sample; and an uptake bound far above saturation makes
  every viable medium grow at the same rate. `data.medium_spec` fixes both: it
  bisects for the limiting bound, scans for essential exchanges, and reads each
  nutrient's **own uptake demand** off the LP (`estimate_demand`). Demands span
  orders of magnitude, so a shared sampling band leaves the small ones saturated
  and growth cannot respond to them — that is a data-generation defect no
  rescaling or extra data can undo. All three go to `medium_spec.json` for the
  active loop to reuse. `params.min_growth_frac` makes `MERGE_DATA` abort when
  the target is flat.
- **Limit a few nutrients per medium, not all of them.** `titrate` gives every
  offered nutrient its own demand-relative bound but only makes `n_limiting`
  (default 3) of them scarce; the rest sit replete at 2-5x demand. Titrating all
  ~110 at once makes growth a minimum over everything: the target's spread
  collapses (std 5.2 -> 0.2) and even a random forest falls from 0.90 to 0.75.
- **A wide medium space needs `--n-features`.** Growth is set by a handful of
  limiting nutrients; the rest are dimensions a dense net memorises noise in.
  `model.select_features` (RF importances, training rows only) picks the input
  view, and it is persisted in the checkpoint alongside the `log1p` input
  transform, so `predict` and the acquisition loop still take full-width media.
  It is a sweep axis (`params.n_features_list`, cell suffix `__f<n>`) because the
  best width moves with dataset size and community: on one community at 2400 rows,
  8/16/32 features gave R2 0.56/0.86/0.70 against 0.44 for all 96.
- **HiGHS backs the default `hybrid` solver** — no CPLEX/Gurobi licence (`highspy`
  is in the `data` extra).
- **No slurm/test profile in-repo** — layer the executor via an external
  `-c site.config`; `max_cpus/max_memory/max_time` cap `process.resourceLimits`.
- **Community fan-out** picks the top `n_communities_augment` communities by
  feasible-sample count (channel algebra on the merged `samples.csv`).
