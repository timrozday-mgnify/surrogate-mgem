# CLAUDE.md — surrogate-mgem

Two layers: a Python package (`src/surrogate_mgem/`, the surrogate model + CLI)
and a Nextflow pipeline (`main.nf` + `workflows/` + `modules/`) that scales
training across an HPC cluster. This page is the map; read the linked code for
detail.

## Python package

`surrogate-mgem <subcommand>` (`cli.py`), consumed by the pipeline:

| Subcommand | Does | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generate` | Sample communities + media, solve MICOM, write tidy CSVs. Shardable via `--num-shards/--shard-index` (shard 0 writes `exchange_universe.json`). | `data` extra (micom/cobra) |
| `train` | Fit a fixed-community ensemble. Sweep knobs: `--hidden` (layers×width), `--n-models` (ensemble size), `--n-train` (training-row cap). Writes `train_metrics.json`. | torch only |
| `active-round` | One active-learning round for one community: train acquisition ensemble → solve a diverse high-uncertainty batch → append to the tidy tables (single-community output dir). | `data` extra |
| `report` | Quarto performance report (local, not in the HPC path). | `report` extra + quarto |

Model: `model.py` `GrowthSurrogate` (standardising ReLU MLP; `hidden` architecture
is **persisted in the checkpoint** so a sweep can vary it). `ensemble.py`
`GrowthEnsemble` (deep ensemble → predictive std = acquisition signal).
`active.py` `active_round` / `active_learning_loop`. `train.py`
`run_active_round` does the tidy-table writeback.

## Nextflow pipeline

House style mirrors `../subspecies-phylogeny`: DSL2, meta maps, `conf/base.config`
labels + retry, `conf/modules.config` for `ext.args`/publishDir, nf-test stub
tests, per-process container ternary.

DAG (`workflows/surrogate_training.nf`):

```
GENERATE_DATA (per shard) ─┐
                           ├─ MERGE_DATA ─ pick top communities ─┐
                           ┘                                     │
   ACTIVE_LEARN (per community: N discrete active-round calls    │
     folded in one task, dataset grows each round) ──────────────┤
                                                                 │
   TRAIN_SURROGATE (per cell = community × hidden × n_models      │
     × n_train) ── COLLECT_METRICS ── leaderboard.csv ───────────┘
```

| Module | Image | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GENERATE_DATA` | `surrogate-mgem-data` | process_high |
| `MERGE_DATA` | `surrogate-mgem-train` | process_low |
| `ACTIVE_LEARN` | `surrogate-mgem-data` | process_medium |
| `TRAIN_SURROGATE` | `surrogate-mgem-train` | process_low |
| `COLLECT_METRICS` | `surrogate-mgem-train` | process_single |

### Conventions / things easy to get wrong

- **Iteration lives inside a process, not the DAG.** Nextflow forbids invoking a
  process more than once, so `ACTIVE_LEARN` folds `params.active_rounds` discrete
  `active-round` calls in a bash loop (like the reference's `accumulating_merge`),
  rather than unrolling per-round Nextflow tasks. Each round is still a distinct
  CLI invocation that grows the dataset.
- **Data-size sweep = `--n-train` cap** on a fixed dataset (a learning curve), not
  active-round snapshots.
- **Containers only** (no bioconda package) — the modules are container-only with
  no `environment.yml`; the `conda` profile won't cover them. Two images, built
  out-of-repo via `docker/{train,data}.Dockerfile`, referenced by GHCR convention
  (`ghcr.io/timrozday-mgnify/surrogate-mgem-{train,data}:0.1.0`, `-sif` ORAS for
  singularity). Bump the tag in all five modules together.
- **HiGHS backs the default `hybrid` solver** — no CPLEX/Gurobi licence (`highspy`
  is in the `data` extra).
- **No slurm/test profile in-repo** — layer the executor via an external
  `-c site.config`; `max_cpus/max_memory/max_time` cap `process.resourceLimits`.
- **Community fan-out** picks the top `n_communities_augment` communities by
  feasible-sample count (channel algebra on the merged `samples.csv`).

### Dev commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"            # + ".[dev,data]" for the solver stack
pytest                             # solver-free units (incl. active-round writeback)
nf-test test tests/default.nf.test # stub pipeline (no solver, no containers)
```
